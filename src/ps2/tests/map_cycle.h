 * File: map_cycle.h
 * Brief: Memory smoke test that loads every stock map in sequence, in the order the game
 *        plays them, and logs what each one costs.
 *
 *        The point is the *transitions*, not the maps: a map change is the worst moment in
 *        the program, because the outgoing map's data can still be resident while the next
 *        one is built. Playing the units in order reproduces the real sequence of those
 *        transitions, which is where every out-of-memory failure in this port has happened.
