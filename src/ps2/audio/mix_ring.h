 * File: mix_ring.h
 * Brief: The buffer the stock Quake mixer paints into (dma.buffer), and the bookkeeping
 *        that turns it into something audsrv can be fed.
 *
 *        The engine wants a ring it can write anywhere in and a play cursor it can read
 *        back; audsrv wants a queue it can be handed chunks of. MixRing bridges the two
 *        exactly the way id's own waveOut backend (win32/snd_win.c) did: the position
 *        reported to the engine is how far we have *submitted*, not where the SPU2
 *        actually is. Because submission is paced by the device's free space, that
 *        cursor advances at precisely the playback rate, and - unlike a real play
 *        position - it is monotonic by construction. GetSoundtime() requires exactly
 *        that (it infers buffer wraps from the value decreasing), and it means a stall
 *        long enough to drain the queue, such as a level load, recovers on its own with
 *        no resync logic. The cost is latency: s_mixahead plus the queue depth, which
 *        is the same deal the waveOut path shipped with.
 *
 * This source code is released under the GNU GPL v2 license.
