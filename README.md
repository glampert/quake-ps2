# Quake port for the PlayStation 2

## Overview

This is an unofficial fan-made port of id Software's Quake to the PlayStation 2 console. It derives
from [QuakeSpasm][link_quakespasm] 0.97.0, the modern, faithful Quake engine based on FitzQuake and
id's GPL source release: the engine, client, server and QuakeC virtual machine here are
QuakeSpasm's. id's original release notes for the Quake source code are in
[src/README.md](src/README.md).

Like the [Quake II port][link_q2_ps2] it builds on, it relies solely on the free
[PS2DEV SDK][link_ps2_dev], with no official Sony SDK and no proprietary libraries. The goal is a fully
functional and playable single-player Quake on the PS2, built entirely with freely available tools.

QuakeSpasm's C code under [src/quake/](src/quake/) is kept as close to untouched as possible; every change
is tagged `// [PS2_QUAKE]: <why>`. Everything specific to the console lives in [src/ps2/](src/ps2/) and is
written in modern C++ (C++20, no exceptions, no RTTI, warnings-as-errors). That backend comes from the
Quake II port: its renderer (GS front-end, VRAM texture heap, VU1 microprograms), input, audio, memory and
debugging code carry over, ported to QuakeSpasm's interfaces.

### Status

**Early bring-up.** QuakeSpasm boots on the PS2 and runs its game loop headless: in PCSX2 it
finds the game data on `host:`, initializes, and plays the attract-mode demos through, logging
the console to stdout, with nothing drawn yet. The port is brought up in phases, each checked
in PCSX2:

1. Compile QuakeSpasm with the EE toolchain. *Done.*
2. Link and boot, rendering nothing and logging to stdout. *Done.*
3. Game data and the game loop, headless.
4. 2D: console, menus, HUD.
5. Input: DualShock and USB keyboard.
6. 3D: world, lightmaps, water, sky, models, sprites, particles.
7. Sound, CD music, save games.

This section says what works as each phase lands.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. **The ps2dev toolchain and PS2SDK.** Build/install from [ps2dev][link_ps2_dev]
   (`ps2toolchain` + `ps2sdk`). The build expects these on `PATH`:

   | Tool | Comes from | Typical location |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `mips64r5900el-ps2-elf-gcc` / `-g++` | ps2toolchain | `$PS2DEV/ee/bin` |
   | `openvcl` | openvcl | `$PS2DEV/bin` |
   | `dvp-as` | ps2toolchain (dvp) | `$PS2DEV/dvp/bin` |
   | `bin2c` | ps2sdk | `$PS2SDK/bin` |

   A `~/.zshenv` (or equivalent) along these lines is what the Makefile and the VSCode tasks expect:

   ```sh
   export PS2DEV=$HOME/ps2dev
   export PS2SDK=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk
   export PATH=$PS2DEV/bin:$PS2DEV/ee/bin:$PS2DEV/dvp/bin:$PS2SDK/bin:$PATH
   ```

2. **PCSX2**, to run it on the emulator, plus a PS2 BIOS image for it. The Makefile's `run` target
   defaults to `/Applications/PCSX2.app/Contents/MacOS/PCSX2`; override `PCSX2=` elsewhere.

3. **The Quake game data.** It is not included here. Place it in an `id1/` directory at the root of
   the repository (it is `.gitignore`d): either the shareware `pak0.pak` (episode 1), or the
   registered game's `pak0.pak` and `pak1.pak`.

   ```
   quake-ps2/
     id1/
       pak0.pak
       pak1.pak   (registered game only)
   ```

### Building

Three dependencies come in as git submodules: [vclpp](https://github.com/glampert/vclpp), the
preprocessor the VU microprograms go through, at [src/tools/vclpp/](src/tools/vclpp/) (with a submodule
of its own), [vu-checker](https://github.com/glampert/vu-checker), the checks every VU build runs over
the toolchain's output, at [src/tools/vu-checker/](src/tools/vu-checker/), and
[miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz), the deflate codec for save games, at
[src/tools/miniz/](src/tools/miniz/). Clone with `--recursive`, or run
`git submodule update --init --recursive` in an existing clone.

```sh
make            # debug build   -> build/debug/quake.elf (+ host tools)
make release    # optimized     -> build/release/quake.elf
make run        # build, then launch it in PCSX2
```

| | `make` (debug) | `make release` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Optimization | `-O2` | `-O3` |
| Debug info | `-gdwarf-2 -gz` | none |
| `PS2_Assert` / `PS2_AssertMsg` | on | compiled out |
| `PS2_QUAKE_DEBUG` (tests, debug-only code) | in | compiled out |

Both configs strip the ELF that runs; the symbols stay next to it in `quake_unstripped.elf`, which is
the one to feed `addr2line` or `build/tools/symbolize`. `make compiledb` regenerates
`compile_commands.json` for IntelliSense/clangd, and `make clean` removes all build output.

### Running in PCSX2

`make run` symlinks `build/<config>/id1` to the repo's `id1/` and launches
`PCSX2 -batch -elf build/<config>/quake.elf`. PCSX2 needs a few settings that are **off by default**.
Edit `~/Library/Application Support/PCSX2/inis/PCSX2.ini` (macOS) **while PCSX2 is closed**, since it
rewrites the file on exit:

```ini
[EmuCore]
HostFs = true             ; host: maps to the ELF's directory; without it there is no game data

[Logging]
EnableIOPConsole = true   ; the game's stdout goes through the IOP
EnableFileLogging = true  ; ...and into logs/emulog.txt

[USB1]
Type = hidkbd             ; optional: a USB keyboard that passes host keystrokes through
```

The engine's console output is prefixed with `[Q1]` in the log:

```sh
tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/PCSX2/logs/emulog.txt | grep '\[Q1\]'
```

    host/               host-side command line tools (unpak, musenc)
    scripts/            Python helpers (symbolize, compile_commands.json, frame logs)
    vclpp/              VCL preprocessor for the VU microprograms (git submodule)
    vu-checker/         openvcl/dvp-as output checks run by every VU build (git submodule)
    miniz/              deflate codec for the save games (git submodule)
    vscode_extensions/  VCL/VU assembly syntax highlighting for VSCode
```

Much of `src/ps2` is still the Quake II port's code, waiting for the phase that ports it.

## Credits

- [QuakeSpasm][link_quakespasm], which this port derives from: everything under [src/quake/](src/quake/)
  is QuakeSpasm 0.97.0's code, by the QuakeSpasm developers, changed only where tagged `[PS2_QUAKE]`.
  QuakeSpasm is itself based on John Fitzgibbons' FitzQuake.
- id Software's Quake, released under the GPL in 1999 ([source][link_id_repo]; the original release
  notes are in [src/README.md](src/README.md)).
- The PS2 backend under [src/ps2/](src/ps2/) comes from the [Quake II port][link_q2_ps2].
